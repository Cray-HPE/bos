# The purpose of this file is to contain python runtime requirements
# for controller code, e.g., code authored by developers, as opposed to
# automatically-generated code. Requirements from automatically-generated
# code are stored in lib/bos/server/requirements.txt (within the associated
# docker image), and are referenced above.
