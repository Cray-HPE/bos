Starting in CSM 1.6, BOS is enforcing many API restrictions for the first time.
When migrating to this BOS version, this tool will attempt to clean up the BOS
data so that it complies with the spec (like modifying boot sets so that
rootfs_providers mapping to empty strings instead are not included in the boot set).
It will only delete BOS resources in two cases:

1. Cases where ID fields are in violation. For example, if a
session template has an invalid name. The reason this is deleted is because
that template would be inaccessible using the API or CLI, since incoming
requests would be rejected for not following the spec. For session templates
specifically, however, an attempt will be made to modify the name to comply
with the requirements. Only if that fails will the template be deleted.

2. Cases where the ID fields inside the data structure conflicts with the
database key. That is, if generating the DB key based on the fields in the
actual data result in a different database key than the one used to look it up.
This is not something that is likely to happen, but given the lack of spec
enforcement that existed in the past, we can't rule it out. In this case,
for session templates, if the expected database key is not in use, then
the resource will be moved to the expected key. Otherwise, or for
non-session templates, it will be deleted.

The CSM upgrade code for 1.6 has been modified to include a BOS backup
before the BOS service is updated. In addition, this migration tool will
log all data that is deleted. And the migration pod has been modified
so that it stays around for much longer after completing.
