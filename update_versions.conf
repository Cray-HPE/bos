#tag: Version tag string to be replaced (optional -- if unspecified @VERSION@ is assumed)
#
#sourcefile: File to obtain the actual version from (optional -- if unspecified, .version is assumed)
#            If this file is executable, it will be executed and the output will be used as the version string.
#            Otherwise it will be read and its contents will be used as the version string, with any leading and
#            trailing whitespace stripped. The version string is validated by the update_version.sh string to
#            verify that they match the expected version formatting (essentially semver, with a minor exception
#            -- see the script header for details).
#sourcefile-novalidate: This is identical to the previous tag, except that the only validation that is
#            done is to verify that the version string is not blank and does not contain strings which will
#            disrupt the sed command used for the version tag replacement. Essentially, it cannot contain
#            double quotes, forward slashes, or hash symbols. The file does still have leading and trailing
#            whitespace stripped, however.
#targetfile: file in which to have version tags replaced. When this line is reached, the replacement
#            action is performed on this file.
#
#Multiples of any of these lines are allowed. A given line is in effect until another line overrides it.
#For this purpose, the sourcefile and sourcefile-novalidate lines are considered the same (that is, they
#override each other).

# Some of the sourcefile and tag lines below are
# superfluous, but are present for clarity
