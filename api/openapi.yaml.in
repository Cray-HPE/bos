# Cray Boot Orchestration Service (BOS) API Specification
openapi: "3.0.2"

info:
  title: "Boot Orchestration Service"
  version: "0.0.0-api"
  description: |
    The Boot Orchestration Service (BOS) provides coordinated provisioning actions
    over defined hardware sets to enable boot, reboot, shutdown, configuration and
    staging for specified hardware subsets. These provisioning actions apply state
    through numerous system management APIs at the request of system administrators
    for managed product environments.

    The default content type for the BOS API is "application/json". Unsuccessful
    API calls return a content type of "application/problem+json" as per RFC 7807.

    ## Resources


    ### Session Template

    A Session Template sets the operational context of which nodes to operate on for
    any given set of nodes. It is largely comprised of one or more boot
    sets and their associated software configuration.

    A Boot Set defines a list of nodes, the image you want to boot/reboot the nodes with,
    kernel parameters to use to boot the nodes, and additional configuration management
    framework actions to apply during node bring up.

    ### Session

    A BOS Session applies a provided action to the nodes defined in a Session Template.


    ## Workflow: Create a New Session

    1. Choose the Session Template to use.

      Session Templates which do not belong to a tenant are uniquely identified by their
      names. All Session Templates that belong to a given tenant are uniquely identified
      by their names, but may share names with Session Templates that belong to other
      tenants or that do not belong to a tenant.

      a. List available Session Templates.

        GET /v1/sessiontemplate or /v2/sessiontemplates

      b. Create a new Session Template if desired.

        POST /v1/sessiontemplate or PUT /v2/sessiontemplate/{template_name}

        If no Session Template exists that satisfies requirements,
        then create a new Session Template.
        This Session Template can be used to create a new Session later.

    2. Create the Session.

      POST /v1/session or /v2/sessions

      Specify template_name and an operation to create a new Session.
      The template_name corresponds to the Session Template *name*.
      A new Session is launched as a result of this call (in the case of
      /v2/sessions, the option to stage but not begin the Session also exists).

      A limit can also be specified to narrow the scope of the Session. The limit
      can consist of nodes, groups, or roles in a comma-separated list.
      Multiple groups are treated as separated by OR, unless "&" is added to
      the start of the component, in which case this becomes an AND.  Components
      can also be preceded by "!" to exclude them.

      Note, the response from a successful Session launch contains *links*.
      Within *links*, *href* is a string that uniquely identifies the Session.
      *href* is constructed using the Session Template name and a generated UUID.
      Use the entire *href* string as the path parameter *session_id*
      to uniquely identify a Session.

    3. Get details on the Session.

      GET /v1/session/{session_id} or /v2/sessions/{session_id}


    ## Interactions with Other APIs

    ### Configuration Framework Service (CFS)

    If *enable_cfs* is true in a Session Template, then BOS will invoke CFS to
    configure the target nodes during *boot*, *reboot*, or *configure*
    operations. The *configure* operation is only available in BOS v1 Sessions;
    if desiring to only perform a CFS configuration on a set of nodes, it is
    recommended to use CFS directly.

    ### Hardware State Manager (HSM)

    In some situations BOS checks HSM to determine if a node has been disabled.

    ### Image Management Service (IMS)

    BOS works in concert with IMS to access boot images.
    All boot images specified via the Session Template must be available via IMS.

            It is recommended to use names which meet the following restrictions:
            * Maximum length of 127 characters.
            * Use only letters, digits, periods (.), dashes (-), and underscores (_).
            * Begin and end with a letter or digit.

            These restrictions are not enforced in this version of BOS, but they are
            targeted to start being enforced in an upcoming BOS version.

              Boot Sets is not functional.
            * Boot Set names should be 1-127 characters in length.
            * Boot Set names should use only letters, digits, periods (.), dashes (-), and underscores (_).
